# Introduction to Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are particularly useful in machine learning applications, especially for:

1. Similarity search
2. Recommendation systems
3. Image recognition
4. Natural language processing

## Key Features
- Fast nearest neighbor search
- Efficient vector indexing
- Support for high-dimensional data
- Scalability for large datasets

## Common Use Cases
* Semantic search
* Face recognition
* Content recommendation
* Document similarity
